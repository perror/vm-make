			DirtyCow Kernel Flaw Template
			=============================

This template will set-up a VM with an x86 (32-bit) Linux kernel
vulnerable to the DirtyCow vulnerability.

Beware, the kernel has been patched to compile with newer version of
gcc (version 7+). You can find the patch in patches/ilog2_NaN.patch
